I look at stackoverflow top questions🔥, I also love to read popular medium stories from the developers from top tech companies. And yeah, I also catch up with 🎶 🎵podcasts if I am sick of reading 😅.

### What do you look for when you do a code review?

I look for code consistency✅, reusability📦 and readability📖 of the code. I focus more on readability and maintainability📁 of the code on top of anything else, I strongly believe a well written code is nothing more than a well maintainable code.

Few other things I look for are CONSTANTS, let's say I am reviewing the code of the developer who written a function to enable `Place Order` button only if minimum amount of order is met, he can simply do if( cartTotal > 50 ),

For a new developer🐣 who is reading through this code, he has no clue about this magic number(50) appear from no where🙇, I would expect him to create a constants file and have constant like const MINIMUM_ORDER_TO_SHIP = 50 👏 then use the constant.

if( cartTotal > MINIMUM_ORDER_TO_SHIP) 👍 makes the easier to read and maintain🎉, if the company decides to make changes to minimum order, I don't have to dig⚓️ through the files to find this if condition to alter the minimum order to ship, rather I would look for constants file and make the changes accordingly.

Few other things I look for are

- Indentation
- Naming conventions
- Code comments if the block of code has any edge case(Example: like if a coupon is applied, then no minium order is required)
