#### CSS to me is like Kryptonite to Superman.
I have very strong React skills (I overheard from a co-developer in my Team- I embrace it),  
but I was always vulnerable to CSS.   When I’m into a new project, I am always excited about the functionalities I will build. 
Ok this button makes this, and that component can be re used. . So on.
I would built the prototype over couple of hours and rush to the product owner if this is what he was thinking about.
I would lay bunch of elements lying on the UI doing exactly what they are suppose to do. . . 
But a Button is overlapped by an image, and icon are scattered as if they are poured on the screen by a dumpster. 

and it makes me feel like having an iron man suit made out of scrap.

After all the struggle of going over many tutorials, udemy course, blogspots, articles on writing better CSS. I was not able to achieve what I am looking for. 

So I set back my self a little bit and asked me what is stopping to learn CSS which has simple elegant user friendly syntax.
Hmmmm. . . . I am applying a random solution to a problem with out completely understanding the problem.( The bad part is that my problem have more possible solutions than any other).   Now analyzing the problem i found a deep rooted cause. 
 I always underestimated this beautiful language thinking it is all about margins and paddings and with few trial and errors, I should be able to get it. I was wrong in every possible dimension in the universe. 

It's high time to invest more time in to my CSS skills.
